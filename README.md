# NSStringEmojiExtension
A category on NSString that can find all ranges of emojis in a string.

Originally developed for the Wavy app (https://wavy-app.com) to increase the font size for messages that contained only emojis.

The category allows for single-method checking wether the string contains only emojis, offers ways to find the ranges within an NSString that consist solely of emojis and allows to strip emojis from a string.

Enjoy.
